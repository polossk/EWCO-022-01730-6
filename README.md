> In this paper, we present a hybrid dual-variable-horizon peridynamics/ continuum mechanics modeling approach and a strength-induced adaptive coupling algorithm to simulate brittle fractures in porous materials. Peridynamics theory is promising for fracture simulation since it allows discontinuities in the displacement field. However, they remain computationally expensive. Besides, there exists the surface effect in peridynamics due to the incomplete neighborhoods near the boundaries, including the outer boundaries and the boundaries of inner pores in porous materials. The proposed approach couples continuum mechanics and peridynamics into a closed equation system and an adaptive algorithm is developed to activate the peridynamics according to a strength criterion. And the surface effect is corrected by introducing an improved peridynamic model with dual and variable horizons. We conduct the simulations by using the relevant discretization scheme in each domain, i.e., the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method in the peridynamic domain and the continuous finite element method in the continuum mechanics domain. Two-dimensional numerical examples illustrate that successful fracture simulations of random porous materials can be achieved by this approach. Additionally, the impact of distribution, shape, and size of pores on the fractures of porous materials is also investigated.
* 用于随机多孔材料自适应断裂模拟的对偶变邻域近场动力学-连续介质力学耦合模型
> 在本文中，我们提出了一种对偶变邻域近场动力学/连续介质力学耦合模型和一种强度诱导自适应耦合算法来模拟多孔材料的脆性断裂。近场动力学理论对于裂缝模拟很有前景，因为它允许位移场中的不连续性。但是，它们的计算成本仍然很高。此外，由于边界附近的不完整邻域，包括多孔材料的外边界和内孔边界，近场动力学中存在表面效应。所提出的方法将连续介质力学和近场动力学耦合到一个封闭的方程系统中，并开发了一种自适应算法来根据强度准则激活近场动力学。并且通过引入具有双和可变层位的改进的近场动力学模型来校正表面效应。我们通过在每个域中使用相关的离散化方案进行模拟，即近场动力学域中的不连续 Galerkin 有限元法和连续体力学域中的连续有限元法。二维数值例子表明，通过这种方法可以成功地模拟随机多孔材料的断裂。此外，还研究了孔的分布、形状和尺寸对多孔材料断裂的影响。
